# PapersWithKindle
An automatic service that sends research papers realted to computer science to your kindle. I want to peek my head into the world of research, so might as well start by immersing myself. There are 2 reasons why I developed this project:
1. Learn AWS and Docker
2. Force myself to read papers every couple of days

# Activate Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv /Users/yufeng/PapersWithKindle

source /Users/yufeng/PapersWithKindle/bin/activate

# Resources
All papers have been scrapped from this website, which is annually maintained by Jeff Huang.
